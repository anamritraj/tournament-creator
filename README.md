# Tournament Creator
Creates tournament fixtures based on a given input json file.


## How to setup?
- Clone this repository
- Do `npm install`
- Then run `npm start`

## Where are the results?
Please check the browser console for the fixtures and results. Not very user friendly but I focussed more on the JS logic part than the UI.
